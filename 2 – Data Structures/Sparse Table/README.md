Powerful data structure used for answering range queries in *immutable* arrays. Range queries like max/min element, great common divisor or their indexes and etc. can be answered in O(1) time complexity, but this constant time complexity approach only supports queries of [idempotent functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence). Most queries (like sum) can be answered in O(log(n)) time. Even with this weakness, the sparse table is  an excellent example of the dynamic programming concept.
